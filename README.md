This is a snake game like what you get on old Nokia phones. Currently incomplete.

Currently included:

-Main menu with the only working option to play gamne

-Music played throughout

-Snake that moves using arrow keys

-Food that spawns in a random location

-Snake collision with food makes the snake larger and respawns the food

-Current score is shown on the top of the screen

-Game should automatically detect monitor resolution

TODO List:

-Sounds for when food is eaten

-Ways to die including more interesting than the default game hopefully

-Escape key gives you the option to go to the main menu, quit game, and go to an options screen to change the volume of the game for example

-Better images to replace elements of the game and make it look a bit better

-Maybe add more maps with different walls

-Change speed to somehow scale with the resolution the player is playing at (big screens have more space to move the snake currently).

-Whatever else I can think of
